<p>In October of 1997, I accepted a producer position at KAIT-TV in Jonesboro, Arkansas. I
was producing the Six o'clock news. What might&nbsp; have been somewhat amazing to many
was that KAIT was rather advanced for a small station in a single station market. They
were completely computerized in the newsroom. Each reporter and producer station had a
computer running Windows&#153; 95 and Tektronix NewStar® software. It didn't take me long
at all to get comfortable with the software.</p>

<p>There was a problem, however. During the <a href="definitions.htm#tease"> tease</a>
before each commercial <a href="definitions.htm#break">break</a>, the anchors were to read
short one line comments about upcoming stories. During this tease the producer was to
write an introductory element that mentioned the names of three of the <a
href="definitions.htm#towns"> towns</a> and <a href="definitions.htm#communities">
communities</a> that were in the station's <a href="definitions.htm#market"> coverage area</a>.
Each producer had a list of the three hundred fifty or so communities and was supposed to
randomly choose three of them for each tease.&nbsp; There were at least three to five
teases per newscast.</p>

<p>As a producer, I felt I had enough work to do and I didn't need to keep track of which
communities I had used and which I hadn't. Management and the consultants wanted these
communities mentioned before every break.</p>

<p>The result was the birth in late 1997 of <i>Town Chooser Version 1.0.</i> This simple
program used a text file to keep a list of the towns in and randomly selected three town.
After the towns were selected, they were placed in the computer's clipboard and the
producer could then paste them into their script in NewStar®. The anchor was then able to
read &quot;When we return for our friends in Cardwell, Swifton, and Canebreak . . . &quot;</p>

<p>The problem with <i>Town Chooser 1.0</i> was that there was no way for the average user
to edit the communities.&nbsp; I had written the application pretty hastily and when I
created the text file containing the towns from the list of towns the producers had to
work with I ended up misspelling some towns and have typos in the names. Whenever we
discovered a town that had a typo or was misspelled I had to go into the text file with
Notepad and correct the town. The problem with that was, as with most users, the other
producers had difficulty remembering to write down the town that was misspelled and let me
know about it. Also, while it was easy to use, it still required some explanation and
training for new producers.</p>

<p>I've since left KAIT but some of the producers still like to use the program.&nbsp;
They need, however, to be able to edit the towns.&nbsp; I also realized that other
stations might be able to use this same type of application if it had editing
capabilities.</p>

<p><i>Town Chooser 2.0</i> is the result. This version uses an actual database engine and
allows for the adding, editing, and deleting of town names. It also includes this HTMLHelp
file, a PowerPoint training demonstration, and a licensing agreement. Future versions of
this application will add the ability of the application to pronounce community names on
those computers having sound equipment.</p>
