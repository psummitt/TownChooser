<p>When you <a href="definitions.htm#click"> click</a> the Get New Cities <a
href="definitions.htm#button">button</a>, <i>Town Chooser 2.0</i> automatically puts the
three names in the Windows clipboard.&nbsp; The clipboard is available from any
application running in Windows so change to your program where your script is being
written.</p>

<p>Once the names of the three towns are in the clipboard, all you have to do is find the
place in the script where you want the three <a href="definitions.htm#towns">towns</a>,
place your <a href="definitions.htm#mouse"> mouse</a> <a href="definitions.htm#cursor">
cursor</a> there, and paste the three names into the script.</p>

<p>Pasting can be done a variety of ways.&nbsp; In fact, there's at least three different
ways to do it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many producers don't like to lift their hands from the keyboard while they're typing so
    the keyboard control key shortcut is one of the favorite pasting methods out there.&nbsp;
    All you have to do is press the control key and the letter V at the same time and whatever
    is in your clipboard will be pasted at the location of your cursor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>One of my favorite, if you're using the <a href="definitions.htm#mouse">mouse</a>, is to
    use the <a href="definitions.htm#right-click"> right click</a> <a
    href="definitions.htm#button">button</a>.&nbsp; Right clicking brings down a <a
    href="definitions.htm#menu"> menu</a> of options that are available in the application
    you're currently working in.&nbsp; Paste is one of these.&nbsp; Place your mouse cursor
    where you want the three towns to be located in your script and right click.&nbsp; Pick
    the <b> Paste</b> option from the drop down menu and left click. The three towns are now
    placed in your script at the location you're selected.</li>
  <li>Finally, look on the toolbar of your application you're using to write the script. There
    should be something that looks somewhat like a clipboard.&nbsp; That's probably your paste
    button.&nbsp; Just place your mouse cursor at the location you want the three towns
    located at and click the left mouse button on the application's paste button. The three
    towns are placed where you wanted them.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>See . . . I told you it was simple.</p>
