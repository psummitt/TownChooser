<p>This is what the program was designed to do . . . to randomly get the names of three <a
href="definitions.htm#towns"> towns</a> so that they can be pasted into a script for a <a
href="definitions.htm#tease">tease</a>.&nbsp; The question is, how do you do that?</p>

<p>The answer is simple.&nbsp; In fact, the <a
href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popup1, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)"> Status Bar</a> is telling
you what to do.</p>

<p>See the big long <a href="definitions.htm#button"> button</a> in the lower middle of
the <i> Town Chooser</i> <a href="definitions.htm#window">window</a>?&nbsp; Move your <a
href="definitions.htm#mouse"> mouse</a> <a href="definitions.htm#cursor"> cursor</a> over
the Get New Cities button.</p>

<p>Again you get more assistance as the <a
href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popup2, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)"> Tool Tip</a> pops up telling
you to <a href="definitions.htm#click"> click</a> the left mouse button one time. You now
see three community names listed just above the button as in the following graphic.</p>

<p>Notice now that the <a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popup1, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">
Status Bar </a> is telling you to <a href="pastetownnames.htm"> paste the names</a> into
your script ant that's the next thing we're going to show you how to do in this help file.</p>
