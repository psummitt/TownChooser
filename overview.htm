            <div class="container">
                <p>In October of 1997, I accepted a producer position at KAIT-TV in Jonesboro, Arkansas. I
                    was producing the six o'clock news. What might have been somewhat amazing to many
                    was that KAIT was rather advanced for a small station in a single station market. They
                    were completely computerized in the newsroom. Each reporter and producer station had a
                    computer running Windows&#153; 95 and Tektronix NewStar&copy; software. It didn't take me long
                    at all to get comfortable with the software.</p>
                <p>There was a problem, however. During the <a href="definitions.htm#tease"> tease</a>
                    before each commercial <a href="definitions.htm#break">break</a>, the anchors were to read
                    short one line comments about upcoming stories. During this tease the producer was to
                    write an introductory element that mentioned the names of three of the <a
                    href="definitions.htm#towns"> towns</a> and <a href="definitions.htm#communities">
                    communities</a> that were in the station's <a href="definitions.htm#market"> market or coverage area</a>.
                    Each producer had a list of the three hundred fifty or so communities and was supposed to
                    randomly choose three of them for each tease. There were at least three to five
                    teases per newscast.</p>
                <p>As a producer, I felt I had enough work to do and I didn't need to keep track of which
                    communities I had used and which I hadn't. Management and the consultants wanted these
                    communities mentioned before every break.</p>        
                <p>The result was the birth in late 1997 of <i>Town Chooser Version 1.0.</i> This simple
                    program used a text file to keep a list of the towns in and randomly selected three towns.
                    After the towns were selected, they were placed in the computer's clipboard and the
                    producer could then paste them into their script in NewStar&copy;. The anchor was then able to
                    read &quot;When we return for our friends in Cardwell, Swifton, and Canebreak . . . &quot;</p>    
                <p>The problem with <i>Town Chooser 1.0</i> was that there was no way for the average user
                    to edit the communities. I had written the application pretty hastily and when I
                    created the text file containing the towns from the list of towns the producers had to
                    work with I ended up having misspellings of some towns and typos in the others. Whenever we
                    discovered a town that had a typo or was misspelled I had to go into the text file with
                    Notepad and correct the town. The problem with that was, as with most users, the other
                    producers had difficulty remembering to write down the town that was misspelled and let me
                    know about it. Also, while it was easy to use, it still required some explanation and
                    training for new producers.</p>
                <p>It's been many years since I left KAIT.  The news director contacted me saying some of the producers still liked to use the program.
                    They needed, however, to be able to edit the towns. I also realized that other
                    stations might be able to use this same type of application if it had editing
                    capabilities.</p>
               <p><i>Town Chooser 2.0</i> was the result. This version used an actual database engine and
                    allowed for the adding, editing, and deleting of town names. It also includes an HTMLHelp
                    file (that this site is based on), a PowerPoint training demonstration, and a licensing agreement.
                    Future versions of the program were planned to provide the ability to pronounce community names on
                    those computers having sound equipment.</p>
